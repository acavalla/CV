I am a driven, practical and sociable junior web developer. I trained as a scientist, but I'm looking for a new challenge in software development. I've just completed the Maker's 12-week course; please feel free to look around my Github.

I'm seeking a large company, preferably with training structures in place, access to professional mentors, and clear career progression. It's my goal to work on tech for social good: for example, providing accessibility services to people who need them, or implementing community sharing platforms to reduce waste.

## Skills

**Self-led learning**

During my time at UBC, Eli Lilly, and Maker's, I used the tools at my disposal to pick up new technologies rapidly. I used a combination of walkthroughs, targeted Google/StackOverflow searches, and documentation pages to build up my own knowledge and confidence. I am attuned to knowing when my learning needs hands-on experimenting in the code, and when I would make more progress if I took a step back and delved deeper into the theory behind it. Owing to the anarchic and satellite nature of programming, whatever resource you seek, the internet will have it; it's just a matter of knowing how to find it.

**Accuracy**

While working as a copy editor, I honed a keen eye for spelling and grammar mistakes. I worked for a globally renowned journal, so their reputation was on the line, and I took this responsibility seriously. This skill translates well to coding: I can always spot a missing full stop or an extraneous bracket, and am happy to pass on the info. Luckily in coding it's always received well, and prevents confusing bugs later down the line.

**Resilience**

As a data cleanser at the NHS, my role was to remove personal identifying information from incident reports such that they complied with GDPR data regulations. There was often a bottleneck further up the pipeline, which resulted in a large backlog of reports to clear. Accordingly, I often did over 1000 records in a day, making it an extremely repetitive role. I frequently challenged myself to top my previous highest score, without compromising on quality. I did this by focusing on the end goal of better patient care.
