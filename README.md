I am a driven, practical and sociable junior web developer. I trained as a scientist, and now I'm looking for a new challenge in software development. I've just completed the Maker's 12-week course; please feel free to look around my Github.

I have 8 years' experience in commercial enterprise and world-class research institutions. I thrive in a collaborative environment and love to teach myself, whether it's programming, cooking, or geography. I find coding fascinating because of its contrasting natures of pedantry and creativity: how solving sticky coding problems requires rigid logic combined with lateral thinking.

I'm seeking a large company, preferably with training structures in place, access to professional mentors, and clear career progression. It's my goal to work on tech for social good: for example, connecting people with accessibility services, creating free open-source educational resources, or implementing community sharing platforms to reduce waste.

## Experience

**Eli Lilly** _(08-2018 to 01-2019)_  
Bioinformatician

Global pharmaceutical company at which I worked with sensitive data. I **rapidly taught myself RShiny and used it to build an app** to collate and present relevant data to help identify new genetic targets for Alzheimer disease. I **worked with my team and manager** to identify which visualisations and analysis would be most useful, and worked alone to create a useful, scientifically sound app with arresting graphics. It was **incorporated into the drug development process** and allowed earlier focus on drugs with relevant targets, reducing costs.
[Tech: R, RShiny, JavaScript, HTML, CSS]

**UBC** _(09-2016 to 05-2018)_  
Trainee bioinformatician

World-class research institution The Genome Sciences Centre in Vancouver at which I analysed tumour genomes with R. I also worked with a team at a weekend hackathon to **write tutorials for lesser-known clustering algorithms**, which were then adopted by professors as teaching aids.
[Tech: R, Rmarkdown]

**Healx** _(01-2016 to 08-2016)_
Trainee bioinformatician and science writer

Biotech startup at which I learnt simple **Python** scripting and used it to identify funding sources from publicly available data. I also wrote the company blog to **communicate rare disease theory to patients, patient families and potential investors**.


## Skills

**Self-led learning**

During my time at UBC, Eli Lilly, and Maker's, I used the tools at my disposal to pick up new technologies rapidly. I used a combination of walkthroughs, targeted Google/StackOverflow searches, and documentation pages to build up my own knowledge and confidence. I learnt how to identify when I need hands-on experimenting with the code, and when I would make more progress if I took a step back and delved deeper into the theory behind it. Owing to the anarchic and satellite nature of programming, whatever resource you seek, the internet will have it; it's just a matter of knowing how to find it. During the last 16 weeks, I've got to grips with **two programming languages (Ruby and JavaScript)**, and built projects using dozens of other tools. I've attended five **external reviews to evaluate information gathering from a client, programming level, debugging, process, and modelling**, and **taken on board feedback** from each to improve iteratively.

**Accuracy**

While working as a copy editor, I honed a **keen eye for spelling and grammar errors**. I worked for a globally renowned journal, so their reputation was on the line, and I took this responsibility seriously. This skill translates well to coding: I **can always spot a missing full stop or an extraneous bracket**, and am happy to pass on the info. Luckily in coding it's always received well, as it **prevents confusing bugs later down the line and allows the team to focus on the problem**.

**Resilience**

As a data cleanser at the NHS, my role was to remove personal identifying information from incident reports such that they complied with GDPR data regulations. There was often a large backlog of reports to clear, making it an extremely repetitive role, in which I often cleared over 1000 records per day. I **focused on the end goal** of better patient care and **frequently challenged myself** to top my previous highest score, without compromising on quality.
